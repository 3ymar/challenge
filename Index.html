                    HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the most basic building block of the Web. It defines the meaning and structure of web content. 
                    Other technologies besides HTML are generally used to describe a web page's appearance/presentation (CSS) or functionality/behavior (JavaScript).
                </p>

                <p>
                    "HyperText" refers to links that connect web pages to one another, either within a single website or between websites.
                    Links are a fundamental aspect of the Web. By uploading content to the Internet and linking it to pages created by other people,
                    participant in the World Wide Web.

                <p>
                    HTML uses "markup" to annotate text, images, and other content for display in a Web browser. HTML markup includes special "elements" such as
                    as head, title, body, header, footer, article, section, p, div, span, img, aside, audio, canvas, datalist,details, embed,
                    nav, output, progress, video and many others.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Tags in HTML are case insensitive. That is, they can be written in uppercase, lowercase, or a mixture.
                     Example title tag can be written as Title,TITLE or in any other way.

                <p>
                    At its heart, HTML is a fairly simple language made up of elements, which can be applied to pieces of text to give them different meaning in a document
                    (Is it a paragraph? Is it a bulleted list? Is it part of a table?), structure a document into logical sections.
                    (Does it have a header? Three columns of content? A navigation menu?), and embed content such as images and videos into a page. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    This module will introduce the first two of these, and introduce fundamental concepts and syntax you need to know to understand HTML.
                    Before starting this module, you don't need any previous HTML knowledge, but you should have at least basic familiarity with using computers and using the web passively
                    (i.e., just looking at it and consuming content).
                </p>
                <p>
                    You should have a basic work environment set up (as detailed in Installing basic software), and understand how to create and manage files
                    files (as detailed in Dealing with files). Both are parts of our Getting started with the web complete beginner's module.

        <section id = "Getting started with HTML" class = "main-selection"><header>Getting started with HTML</header><article>
                <p>
                    Covers the absolute basics of HTML, to get you started — we define elements, attributes, and other important terms, and show where they fit in the language. We also show how a typical HTML page is structured and how an
                    HTML element is structured, and explain other important basic language features. Along the way, we'll play with some HTML to get you interested
                </p>
                <p>
                    The head of an HTML document is the part that is not displayed in the web browser when the page is loaded. It contains information such as the page title, links to CSS
                    (if you want to style your HTML content with CSS), links to custom favicons, and metadata (data about the HTML, such as who wrote it, and important keywords that describe the document)
                </p>
                <p>
                    One of HTML's main jobs is to give text meaning (also known as semantics), so that the browser knows how to display it correctly. This article looks at how to use HTML to break up a block of text into
                     a structure of headings and paragraphs, add emphasis/importance to words, create lists, and more. <br>
                     Hyperlinks are really important — they are what makes the web a web. This article shows the syntax required to make a link, and discusses best practices for links.    
                </p>
                <p>
                    There are many other elements in HTML for formatting text that we didn't get to in the The elements in here are less well-known, but still useful to know about. In this article you'll learn about marking up quotations,
                    description lists, computer code and other related text, subscript and superscript, contact information, and more.
                </p>
                <p> 
                    As well as defining individual parts of your page (such as "a paragraph" or "an image"), HTML is also used to define areas of your website (such as "the header," "the navigation menu," or "the main content column.")
                    This article looks into how to plan a basic website structure and how to write the HTML to represent this structure.

                    Writing HTML is fine, but what if something goes wrong, and you can't work out where the error in the code is? This article will introduce you to some tools that can help.
                    We've looked at a lot of text so far in this course, but the web would be really boring only using text. Let's start looking at how to make the web come alive with more interesting content
                    This module explores how to use HTML to include multimedia in your web pages, including the different ways that images can be included, and how to embed video, audio, and even entire webpages. 
                </p>
            </article>
                <!-- <section id = "Multimedia and Embedding" class = "main-selection"><header>Multimedia and Embedding</header><article></article> -->
        <section id = "Images in HTML" class = "main-selection"><header>Images in HTML</header><article>
                <p>
                    There are other types of multimedia to consider, but it is logical to start with the humble img element used to embed a simple image in a webpage. In this article we'll look at how to use it in more depth, including basics,
                    annotating it with captions using figure, and how it relates to CSS background images
                 </p>
            </article>

        <section id = "Video and Audio Content" class = "main-selection"><header>Video and Audio Content</header><article>
                <p>
                    Next, we'll look at how to use the HTML5 video and audio elements to embed video and audio on our pages, including basics, providing access to different file formats to different browsers, , adding captions and subtitles, and how to add fallbacks for older browsers.
                    (From object to iframe — other embedding technologies)At this point we'd like to take somewhat of a sideways step, looking at a couple of elements that allow you to embed a wide variety of content types into your webpages:
                    The iframe, embed and object elements. iframes are for embedding other web pages, and the other two allow you to embed PDFs, SVG, and even Flash — a technology on its way out, but which you may still see semi-regularly.
                </p>
            </article>

        <section id = "Adding vector graphics to the web" class = "main-selection"><header>Adding vector graphics to the web</header><article>
                </P>
                    Vector graphics can be very useful in certain situations. Unlike regular formats like PNG/JPG, they don't distort/pixelate when zoomed in — they can remain smooth when scaled. This article introduces you to what vector graphics
                    are and how to include the popular SVG format in web pages 
                <P>
            </article>

                <section id = "Responsive images" class = "main-selection"><header>Responsive images</header><article>
                </P>
                With so many different device types now able to browse the web — from mobile phones to desktop computers — an essential concept to master in the modern web world is responsive design. This refers to the creation of webpages that can automatically change their features to
                suit different screen sizes, resolutions, etc. This will be looked at in much more detail in a CSS module later on, but for now, we'll look at the tools HTML has available to create responsive images, including the picture element.
                A very common task in HTML is structuring tabular data, and it has a number of elements and attributes for just this purpose. Coupled with a little CSS for styling, HTML makes it easy to display tables of information on the web such as your school lesson plan,
                ,the timetable at your local swimming pool, or statistics about your favorite dinosaurs or football team. This module takes you through all you need to know about structuring tabular data using HTML.

        <section id = "HTML Table basics" class = "main-selection"><header>HTML Table basics</header><article>
                <p>
                This article gets you started with HTML tables, covering the very basics such as rows and cells, headings, making cells span multiple columns and rows, and how to group together all the cells in a column for styling purposes.
                HTML table advanced features and accessibility 
                In the second article in this module, we look at some more advanced features of HTML tables — such as captions/summaries and grouping your rows into table head, body and footer sections — as well as looking at the accessibility of tables for visually impaired users.
